## Conclusion

Look who made it to the end! üöÄ

Yes, you!

I‚Äôve poured my heart into this book, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve learned a thing or two.

So, where do you go next?

Firstly, I strongly recommend visiting the official Astro [documentation](https://astro.build/). It‚Äôs a great resource that‚Äôll benefit you long-term as you develop Astro applications.

Secondly, ponder the features that make Astro stand out:

- **Leverage Component Islands**: A new web architecture for building faster websites.
- **Zero JS, by default**: Keep applications fast with no JS runtime overhead.
- **Edge-ready**: Deploy anywhere, even global edge runtimes like Deno or Cloudflare.
- **Incredibly customizable**: Use Tailwind, MDX, and 100+ other [integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/).
- **Bring your own framework**: Supports React, Preact, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Lit and more.
